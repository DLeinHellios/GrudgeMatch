## Description
GrudgeMatch is a (soon-to-be) versatile record-keeper for competitive two-player games. Built with fighting games in mind, the goal of this project is to provide simple, extensible recordkeeping that can be later utilized and showcased in a variety of competitive settings. It is written in Python and Tkinter, and should work on a default Python 3+ installation on Windows and Linux. GrudgeMatch is provided under the Apache License 2.0.

*GrudgeMatch is still in development, and is not feature-complete.*
